### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Alejandro from Rosario, Argentina. I am a full-stack developer eager to contribute my experience to remote teams.

I am a student of the Microverse program, where I honed my skills in various programming languages, frameworks and technologies. Excelling in remote collaborative environments, I have refined effective communication, teamwork, and remote work practices. I have earned a reputation for excelling under pressure, constantly demonstrating my prowess through weekly projects. I would like to work with projects that involve technologies like Django or React.

My path towards programming began during my telematics engineering studies, where I delved into Python and C#. Since joining Microverse, I have further expanded my portfolio and developed web applications such as an e-commerce site with a shopping cart, a dynamic book organizer for libraries, and a glamping booking platform.

Additionally, my dedication to being a Project Manager in the mechanical engineering industry for more than 15 years reflects my perseverance and commitment to growth. At my core, I am an adaptable and dedicated professional driven by a passion for technology. With a proven track record of learning and achieving in dynamic environments, I'm ready to bring my skills to your remote team!
